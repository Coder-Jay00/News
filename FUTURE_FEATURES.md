# The Intelligence Brief: Phase 2 Roadmap (25 Features)

This document outlines 25 possible future features to evolve "The Intelligence Brief" from a news aggregator into a world-class **Personal Intelligence Partner**.

## 🧠 AI & Deep Intelligence
1.  **Ask the Analyst (AI Chat)**: An interactive Q&A button on every news card allowing users to ask specific questions about the article context.
2.  **Intelligence Search**: A search bar that triggers a real-time web-crawl and AI synthesis for any topic, moving beyond the current database.
3.  **Impact Heatmap**: A visual score (1-10) indicating if a story is a "Structural Shift" (Disruptive) or merely "Industry Hype."
4.  **Auto-Cross-Reference**: Automatically links current stories to previous reports in the database to show how a story is evolving.
5.  **Fact-Check Overlay**: An AI-driven "Trust Score" that flags potential misinformation or exaggerated hype in viral headlines.
6.  **Sentiment Trend Graphing**: A dashboard view showing the "mood" of specific tech categories (e.g., "AI is currently 80% bullish").
7.  **Multi-Source Synthesis**: Merging 5+ articles about the same event into one "Master Intelligence Report" to eliminate redundancy.

## 🎧 UX & Personalized Interaction
8.  **The Audio Briefing**: A high-quality AI voice that generates a 3-minute "Intelligence Podcast" based on your current top stories.
9.  **The Morning Reel**: A full-screen, card-style presentation shown at first open, summarizing the "Big Three" events of the last 24 hours.
10. **Watchlist Keyword Alerts**: Precision push notifications that trigger only when specific keywords (e.g., "OpenAI o3," "H100 pricing") are detected.
11. **Observer Personas**: A toggle to change the AI's summarizing lens between "Student," "Founder," "Investor," or "Security Researcher."
12. **Offline Subway Mode**: Automatic caching of the day's intelligence, allowing full reading and AI summaries without internet.
13. **Gamified Intelligence**: "Knowledge Streaks" and badges for consistent reading of critical technical briefs.
14. **Custom Notification Logic**: "Only wake me up for [Strategic] news at night, but [Technical] news anytime."

## 💻 Developer & Tech Integration
15. **Dev-Pulse (Code Insights)**: For news about frameworks (Kotlin, React), the AI includes a "Migration Snippet" or code tip for developers.
16. **GitHub Repo Linker**: The bot automatically scans news, finds the related open-source Repository, and adds a direct link to the card.
17. **VS Code Extension Sidebar**: A lightweight extension allowing developers to see their "Brief." directly inside their coding environment.
18. **CLI Intelligence Tool**: A terminal command (`brief latest`) for developers to stay updated without leaving the command line.
