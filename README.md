# The Intelligence Brief 🕵️‍♂️

**Zero Cost. Zero Ads. Pure Signal.**

A "Zero Rupee" intelligence tool designed for tech students and professionals. It scrapes high-signal technical news (AI, Cyber, Geopolitics), summarizes it using Google Gemini (AI), and delivers it to a distraction-free Android application.

## 🏗 Technical Stack

The system follows a **"Headless" Agentic** architecture:

- **The Agent (Python)**: Deployed via GitHub Actions. Automates news discovery, AI reasoning, and database synchronization every 12 hours.
- **The Brain (Gemini 1.5 Flash)**: Processes raw RSS feeds into actionable intelligence. Assigns "Trust Badges" and generates context-aware summaries.
- **The Core (Supabase)**: Real-time PostgreSQL database that bridges the gap between the headless worker and the mobile client.
- **The Terminal (Android)**: A high-performance, native client built with Jetpack Compose. Features biometric-grade focus, offline caching, and native notifications.
